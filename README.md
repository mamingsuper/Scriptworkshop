# Call for Papers: Sharpening Analytic Instruments of Narrative Contestation During Conflicts
**Date**: November 7-8, 2024  
**Location**: Freie Universit√§t Berlin, Germany  
**Organizers**: Professor Alexander Libman, Professor Genia Kostka, Dr. Tomoko Okada, and Dr. Ma Ming

## Theme üåç
We are witnessing increasingly intense conflicts across various regions‚Äîfrom the Russo-Ukrainian War to the ongoing disputes between Israel and Palestine, as well as heightened tensions in the Western Pacific. Amidst these conflicts, parties craft diverse narratives that shape global politics and public opinion, a process known as "narrative warfare." This has a significant ground impact, such as exacerbating polarization in the U.S., leading to significant protests.

The challenges of exploring narrative dynamics are significant due to the episodic and embellished nature of social media-driven narratives. However, the computational turn in communication studies offers new tools that enhance the speed and objectiveness of analysis, providing significant opportunities to transform narrative studies.

## Key Focus Areas üîç
- **Computational Analysis**: How can computational approaches analyze the impact of narratives in policy documents and social media?
- **Authenticity in Narratives**: Distinguishing genuine public sentiment from AI-generated content.
- **Multimodal Data Analysis**: Integrating and analyzing data from various modes to understand narrative contestation.
- **Impact of Digital Media**: Evaluating the role of emojis, images, audios, and videos in narrative construction.
- **Digital Divide**: Addressing the skills gap among researchers in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.
- **Qualitative Methods**: Ensuring the enduring value and validity of qualitative methods within computational social science.

## Keynote Speaker üé§
**Yilang Peng**, Assistant Professor, University of Georgia, USA

## Submission Details ‚úçÔ∏è
Researchers interested in participating should submit a paper title with a 250-300 word abstract addressing one or more workshop themes.
- **Abstract Submission Deadline**: August 26, 2024
- **Acceptance Notification**: September 2, 2024
